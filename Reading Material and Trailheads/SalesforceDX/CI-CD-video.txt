# Elements of CI
1. Environments should match up with the goals you're trying to accomplish.
2. Come up with a Version Control strategy
3. Automate Test Execution
4. Run different tests during different points of the delivery process
5. Branching strategy

#Automated Processes in the world of SFDX
Developer Environment
    -Make changes
    -deploy from local to the scratch org
    -run local tests
    -commit to develop branch
Testing Environment
    -CI tool creates other scratch orgs and deploys code to those orgs
    --Using an SFDX Push (for dev process)
    --Using packages (for sandbox deployment process)
    -Run Tests in both orgs
    -Tear down orgs

#Branching strategy
May be best to line up a branch for each environment in the process.
Want to make a new feature?
    -merge master into develop
    -create feature branch
    -merge to develop. run tests.
    -deploy into QA sandbox for testing.
    -**deploy into staging sandbox to identify candidates for release.

# CI Core Principles
