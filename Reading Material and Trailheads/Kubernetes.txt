Docker is the runtime used to run containers. Servers that are provisioned in the hypervisors have Docker installed inside each of them.
Docker allows you to provision multiple OSes on a server.
Kubernetes is a container-orchestration system. Kubernetes manages containers - can allocate how many containers you have running at a time.
    master nodes - storage nodes, api * where the command is called from.
    worker nodes - infrastructure we control. multiple per master nodes. Each one is like a hypervisor (an OS that can host other OSes).
    every change made to Kubernetes is made through an API. You want all docker containers deployed into the Kubernetes clusters.
Minikube
Kubernetes certificates (master) expire every year.
Anything you create in Kubernetes is restricted automatically. You gain access to the pods through a service (defined through a .yaml file). 
NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress.
Terraform - infrastructure definition. Used to spin up the cluster and host for Kubernetes.
